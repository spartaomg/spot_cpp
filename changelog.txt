[1.4 - 250604]

- New optimization algorithm based on average color fragment length instead of color frequency to predict optimal color placement
- SPOT checks 8192 different color arrangements and selects candidates for best compression based on the number of color fragments created and color combinations used, then passes them through a compression cost calculator to select the one that compresses best as final output
- New command-line switch -v for verbose mode
- New command-line switch -s for simple/speedy mode to bypass compression cost analysis - helpful in case of huge, non-standard images
- SPOT now accepts VICE 384x272px PNG screenshots as input
- KoalaX (.klx) file format for large, non-standard bitmaps (layout is similar to Koala: bitmap width in double pixels [low + high bytes], bitmap height [low + high bytes] followed by bitmap pixel info, screen RAM, color RAM, and background color)
- PEPTOette palette from C64GFX.com

[1.3 - 240428]

Fixed
-----
- Repetitive 'more than 4 colors per char block' error message

Added
-----
- Improved optimization algorithm saving 54 bytes on the test corpus with Dali compared with SPOT 1.2
- Multiple palettes: SPOT now recognizes 63 different palettes from VICE 3.6, VICE 3.8 and Pixcen
- 'g' option for -f switch to save background color as a 1-byte long .BGC file
- 'x' option for -b switch to only save files with the first background color match and ignore any other possible background colors
- Hungarian lowest-cost algorithm to identify best palette match if no exact palette match is found
- Windows GUI version brought up-to-date with C++ CLI version


[1.2 - 240105]

Full rewrite in C++, minor optimizing algorithm update.
